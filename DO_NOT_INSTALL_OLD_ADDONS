Old addons that were made for S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Anomaly before the
release of version 1.5.1 are NOT compatible and WILL cause
problems or crashes !!!

Addons made for versions older than the latest installed update
are also very likely causing problems, uninstall all addons when
updating Anomaly.
